			<p><strong>Right on the tip of Noto Peninsula, a rugged, beautiful stretch of land jutting into the Sea of Japan on Honshu’s west coast, lies Suzu City. Over decades, the region’s Sayotama and Satoumi agrarian communities have formed the bedrock of the community and environment. Far from Japan’s mega-cities, this unique region is a perfect example of the country’s rural side, and serves as the ideal setting for the Oku-Noto Triennale.</strong></p>

			<p>First held in 2017, the Oku-Noto Triennale is famously known for the train stations and empty buildings that have been transformed into works of art which invite visitors to discover local nature, culture and biodiversity. Some of these artworks include an old two-storied bar which has converted into an aquatic-themed museum with wooden sea creatures.</p>

			<p>The disused Noto Railway Uedo Station, for example, was turned into artwork: the Utsushimi (Double image/Token/Emanation), which depicts a building that appears to be floating away from the top of the tiny station. Visitors are asked to contemplate the existence of non-material items.</p>

			<p>At a former daycare center, SHIOTA Chiharu “The Boat Which Carries Time” uses a vessel once used  in salt cultivation. The red strings representing blood and lifelines form a dizzy array of webs above the boat and convey the artist’s belief in the strength of human relationships.</p>
			<p>While at first the region seems remote and rugged by today’s standards — its biggest city, Suzu has been selected by the government of Japan as a future location for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
			<p>The city aims to sustain its population and encourage more tourists through events like the Triennale. </p>

			<h3>MIGRANT’S STORY</h3>
			<p>Local residents are encouraged to participate in these events to reaffirm the power of local resources and pride. Art here has been all about community building and leveraging the power of culture to regenerate this region.</p>

		<p class="text-big">“There were really no places to eat,” she recalled. “It was a problem because we had many visitors who were coming to see ‘Suzu-ware’. I thought I should start a business. I was born into a family who owns a Japanese-style ryokan, so I came up with that idea.”</p>
